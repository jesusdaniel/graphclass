#' Graph classification with node penalized logistic regression
#'
#' @details
#' This package performs classification with network valued covariates
#' using a penalized logistic regression as in \insertCite{relion2017network;textual}{graphclass}.
#'
#' The function \code{\link{graphclass}} fits a regularized logistic regression
#' to a set of graphs with associated class labels. 
#' The package also provides a function \code{\link{plot_adjmatrix}} to plot the adjacency matrix
#' of a graph or square matrix.
#' Two datasets of fMRI brain networks are available in the package. See \code{\link{COBRE.data}} and 
#' \code{\link{UMich.data}}.
