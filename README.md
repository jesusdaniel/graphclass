Code and data for penalized graph classifier method from "Network classification with applications to brain connectomics" https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08140

# R Code

The *graphclass* package implements a penalized graph classifier that promotes node selection. See [**graphclass.pdf**](https://github.com/jesusdaniel/graphclass/blob/master/graphclass.pdf) for usage.

## Installation
To install the package, use the following script:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("jesusdaniel/graphclass")
```

# Data

The COBRE data was obtained from http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/cobre.html (see also [**graphclass.pdf**](https://github.com/jesusdaniel/graphclass/blob/master/graphclass.pdf) for details and references).
